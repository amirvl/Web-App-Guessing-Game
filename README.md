Creative Description:
	
	Test Your Memory with Our Card Game Challenge
	
	In this group project, I took on the primary role of developing the game logic and designing the user interface, while my teammate handled the development from my logic to proper code. The result is a web-based memory game that challenges players to recall details from a deck of playing cards. The game begins by displaying a single card, and as players progress, they must remember increasingly complex details—such as the card’s number, color, and shape, depending on the difficulty level. Each correct answer adds another card to the sequence, making the challenge tougher. Players can see their scores ranked on a leaderboard, motivating them to push their memory limits and beat previous records. How many cards can you remember?
